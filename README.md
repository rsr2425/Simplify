## Notes
This is a very early state for the app, which can be viewed and interacted with here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Rsr2425/Simplify

Note that the "Pull source docs" button for ingesting documentation is not functional yet. For now, the pipelines use a hardcoded url, which is just the single documentation page: https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/

The app however should be able to generate a five question quiz and provide feedback on the correctness of the answers submitted by the user.
